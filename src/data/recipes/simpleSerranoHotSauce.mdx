# Simple Serrano Hot Sauce

 - Ingredients:
   - Serano Peppers (13)
   - Garlic Cloves (4)
   - Distilled White Vinegar
   - Filtered Water
   - Salt
 - Directions:
   - Wash your ingredients.
   - Smash and chop the garlic cloves.
   - Rough chop all of the peppers. The seeds inside the peppers add heat so keep them for a spicier sauce.
   - Bring 1 Cup of water to a boil.
   - Add the chopped peppers and garlic to boiling water.
   - Boil for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent burning; allow the majority of the water to boil out of the pan.
   - Pour the boiled mix directly from the sauce pan into a blender or food processor.
   - Blend the mixture into a paste, ensuring that there are no large chunks left.
   - The paste can be put back into the pot used to boil or left in the blender if it is large enough. No more heating is necessary.
   - Add 3/4 of a cup of distilled white vinegar to the paste.
   - Add 3/4 of a cup of filtered water to the paste.
   - Stir/Blend until the sauce is a uniform consistency.
   - Add salt to taste.
   - Bottle the hot sauce or use it on food!
